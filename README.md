### Customer Type
What else can we learn about the people who use the bikes in NYC? The majority of bikeriders subscribe to the bikesharing program. At first thought it would make sense for the bikes to be used mostly by tourists, but the majority users are locals.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
When do the most people take the bikes? A quick glance at the chart shows that most people bike to work. The most bikes were used in the morning around 8 AM and in the evenings around 5-6 PM. Things to note are that much fewer rides are taken on Wednesday afternoons, but more people take bikes on Thursday evenings.

## Summary

Fianlly, making modifications to the maps made in the module, the following maps show the most popular starting and ending stations across New York City. The maps are filtered on stations that are used more than 10,000 times. The larger the circle, the more times that station was used. Most of the starting and ending stations overlap with a few differences between the two. Filtering down the most popular stations to the statiosn used more than 10,000 times allows the user to see the highest used stations. Hovering over the stations on the map will show a popup with the longitude, latitude, times the station was used, and the station name. It would be important for the company to make sure that these stations are adequately equipped with bikes in both the morning and afternoon during the work week.
